Coretapper

_In memoriam cockatrice.de, mtgimage.com, and many other projects killed by WotC_

DISCLAIMER
---

Coretapper is merely a study in PureScript, please don't deploy it anywhere.

If you deploy it somewhere, please don't tell us about your deployment, so
that when WotC goes turns on community favourite
C&D-[blackmail](http://magiccards.info/scans/en/on/127.jpg)-shit-fan,
all of us can honestly tell them that we shut our deployment down and don't
know of any other deployments of this code.

…

Not like we're going to deploy this code anywhere anyway. Remember, it's
just a study in PureScript.
